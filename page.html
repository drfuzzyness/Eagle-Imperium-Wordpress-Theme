        	<h2>Logo Moton</h2>
			<p>Logo Motion is the 20th FRC game, played in 2011 on a 27' by 54' field. Two alliances of three teams each operate their robots to hang tubes on the scoring pegs on the close side of the field. Two arrays of 3 by 3 pegs lie in each side of the field. Tubes hung on the top rack are worth three points each; middle row hung tubes are worth two points, and bottom row hung tubes are worth one point. During Autonomous period, teams hang ubertubes, which double the value of the tube on the rack. Tele-op period lasts for two minutes following Autonomous period. Any "Logo" of a Triangle-Circle-Square that is hung on one array will double the score for that array's row. Ten seconds before the end of the match, robots can deploy Minibots onto one of the two designated towers for their alliance. Minibots race to the top of the pole with first place earning a thirty point bonus, second place earning a twenty point bonus, third place earning a fifteen point bonus, four place earning a ten point bonus.

			<h2>Design Process</h2>
			<p>Cuddles was built to play <a title="Games" href="http://www.skylinerobotics.org/first/games#Logomotion">Logo Motion</a> and had several design achievements mind: maneuverability, high scoring capability, and reliable minibot deployment. The team quickly identified that one of the hardest things in a match would be driving, so mecanum wheels were chosen to give our driver highest level of maneuverability. Another design challenge that the team overcame was deciding upon which motor would lift our arm. The team settled on two window motors because when the arm was fully lifted, the robot would not have to constantly feed power to the motors to keep it up. Instead, the worm gear within the window motors would keep the arm locked in place.</p>

			<h2>Naming</h2>
			<p>During the lunch period of the Saturday of week 5, students gathered in Mr. Coupland's classroom to decide upon a name for the 2011 robot. Students took their time to suggest names to captain <a href="http://www.skylinerobotics.org/team/students/jeffrey-h/">Jeffrey H.</a> After a bulk of suggestions were suggested, each name was reviewed by the entire team with a vocal confirmation. If a majority of students said a yes, the name would continue to round two; if the name was largely disliked, it was removed from the suggestions board. Only 4 names made it to round two, and the each team member had one vote. Students and mentors voted upon the name that they most liked.</p>

			<div class="highlight"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXvJxDkSY-k" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div>

			<p>The robot had a claw that largely resembled a eagle claw. One student thought that due to the resemblance to the eagle, the robot was hug-able and cuddly, thus arriving to the name suggestion of Cuddles. With a great majority of the team on board with naming the robot Cuddles, the 2011 robot's official name was therefore Cuddles.</p>
